# Ansible
As part of my DevOps studies, I was asked to create an ansible role that does the following steps

copy file from a files folder to hosts 

print 3 time default message with variable who change each time 

print the OS family of host

 set and print a variable 

 save host IP in log.txt on master

 reboot host and save reboot time in log.txt
